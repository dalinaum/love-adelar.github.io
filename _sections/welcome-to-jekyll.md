This Jekyll theme lets you build as many of these sections as you want. They live in the _sections folder in your project's root directory. For some examples, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue). Just be sure to add some [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) to each section.
